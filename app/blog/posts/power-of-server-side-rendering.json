In this post, we'll explore the benefits of SSR and how it works.\n\n## What is Server-Side Rendering?\n\nServer-Side Rendering is the process of rendering web pages on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. This is in contrast to Client-Side Rendering, where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and JavaScript, and then renders the content in the browser.\n\n## Benefits of SSR\n\n1. **Faster Initial Page Load**: SSR can provide a faster initial page load, especially for users with slower internet connections or less powerful devices.\n\n2. **Improved SEO**: Search engines can more easily crawl and index server-rendered content, potentially improving your site's search rankings.\n\n3. **Better Performance on Low-Powered Devices**: SSR reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be parsed and executed on the client, which can be beneficial for users on mobile devices or older computers.\n\n## Implementing SSR in Next.js\n\nNext.js makes it easy to implement SSR. By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to use SSR in Next.js:\n\n```jsx\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ data }) {\n  // Render data...\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nServer-Side Rendering is a powerful tool in web development, offering benefits in performance, SEO, and user experience. By leveraging SSR, especially with frameworks like Next.js, you can create fast, efficient, and search-engine-friendly web applications."
